## Fill these info

### Name: tark salah

### Sec: 1

### B.N.: 44

## Task Explanation

- In this task you are required to solve the fidning pattern problem, implement the functions existing in naive.cpp and hash.cpp
- Each function returns a vector that contains the index of the first letter in the pattern, "zero indexed"
- Example:
  - text = abcab, pattern = ab, output = {0, 3}

### General Notes

- This is an individual based assignment.
- The due date for the submission of this phase is Monday, 10/12/2022 at 11:59 pm.
- Each hour delay will lead to one-point reduction in the homeworkâ€™s grade.
- Your code should be clear, understandable, and documented (comments). Follow a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.
- You are permitted to discuss the following problems with others in the class. However, you must write up your own solutions to these problems. Any indication to the contrary will be considered an act of academic dishonesty.
